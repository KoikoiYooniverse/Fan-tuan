<p style=" float:right";>1. Rinse rice until the water becomes clear. Soak overnight (or at least 6 hours).
Drain well then spread the rice over a piece of wet muslin cloth that’s laid inside a steamer basket (see note 6). Fold the corners to cover the rice completely.
Bring water to a full boil then place the basket over the pot/wok. Cover and leave to steam over medium-low heat for about 30-35 minutes (Check the water level halfway through to avoid drying out).
Keep the rice in the steamer (covered) until you’re ready to assemble.

<p style="float: right"; >2. Lay a piece of cling film (plastic wrap) over the work surface. Sprinkle half of the sesame seeds over.
Place half of the cooked sticky rice on top. Using a spatula or your hand to carefully flatten it into a square shape (each side measures about the same length as a doughnut stick). To prevent sticking, wet spatula or hands with a little water when handling the rice. 
Spread some pickled chili garlic sauce over (optional). Then add half of the scallions, pork floss and preserved mustard stem. 
Place one doughnut stick in the middle. Lift the two sides of the cling film to join the rice towards the centre. Place pressure all over the roll to tightly wrap all the fillings.
Repeat the procedure to make the second roll. Then halve each one and serve immediately.
